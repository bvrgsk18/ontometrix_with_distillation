    You are a Telecom Business Analyst. Identify relationships among these KPIs. For each KPI, its desired direction (high or low value better) and a brief description are provided to help you understand its context and impact.
    metrics can have multiple relationships with other metrics.
    Detect most suitable relationships.
    try to define relationships all for metrics.
    In general Sales related call volume will help to increase gross adds.
    In general Service related call volume , trouble tickets will positively impact wirless disconnects and increases churn rate and decreases NPS score and qes score
    Net adds will increase ARPU.
    For metrics having direction low value is better then use relation ships either ""increases the value of"" or ""decreases the value of"" (e.g., ""Wireless Disconnects, increases the value of, Wireless Churn Rate"", ""Wireless Net Adds, decreases the value of, Wireless Churn Rate"").
    
    There are groups of metrics, e.g., ""Wireless Net Adds*"", ""Wireless Disconnects*"", etc. We need to include an additional relationship as ""related metrics"" if not detected by you.
    For example, the relationships below are DIRECT and ALLOWED:
    1) Wireless Net Adds,decreases the value of,Wireless Churn Rate,""More net adds often reflect improved retention, reducing churn rate.""
    2) Wireless Port Out,increases the value of,Wireless Churn Rate,""More port outs lead to higher churn.""
    3) Number Of Customers with Autopay Discount,decreases the value of,Wireless Churn Rate,""Autopay customers are more stable, reducing churn.""
    4) Number Of Customers with Autopay Discount,decreases the value of,Wireless Port Out,""Autopay users are more loyal, less likely to port out.""
    5) NPS Score,inversely proportional to,Wireless Churn Rate,""High NPS reflects satisfaction, leading to lower churn. Lower NPS score indicates dissatisfaction, leading to higher churn.""
    6) Average Call handling Time - Service,directly proportional to,Wireless Churn Rate,""If average call handlgling for service related call increases , customer dissatifcation increases and churn rate increases.""
    For example, the relationships below are NOT ALLOWED (indirect or incorrect causality):
    1) ARPU,increases the value of,Wireless Net Adds,""Higher ARPU can lead to increased investment in acquiring new wireless subscribers, thus increasing net adds.""
    2) Wireless Churn Rate,negatively impacts,Wireless Net Adds,Higher churn rate results in a decrease in the net adds of wireless subscribers.
    3) NPS Score,increases the value of,Wireless Net Adds,""Higher NPS scores indicate satisfied customers who are more likely to recommend the service, leading to potential growth in net adds.""

The examples below are completely wrong (e.g., how come new customers increase churn rate?):
    1) Wireless Net Adds - New customers,increases the value of,Wireless Churn Rate,Higher net adds of new customers may indicate better retention and lower churn rate.
    2) Wireless Net Adds - Add a Line (AAL),increases the value of,Wireless Churn Rate,More AALs by existing customers may indicate satisfaction and lower likelihood of churn.

If KPIs are clearly part of the same family (e.g., share a common prefix like ""Wireless Net Adds"", ""Wireless Disconnects""), also link them as ""related metrics"" if no direct relationship is detected.
Metrics with Details:
- Wireless Net Adds New customers (Direction: High value is better, Description: Net increase in wireless customers who are entirely new to the service.)
- Wireless Port Out (Direction: Low value is better, Description: Number of wireless customers who transferred their phone number to another carrier.)
- Wireless Net Adds AAL (Direction: High value is better, Description: Net increase in wireless lines by existing customers adding new lines to their accounts.)
- ARPA (Direction: High value is better, Description: Average revenue generated per wireless user over a specific period.)
- Wireless Port In (Direction: High value is better, Description: Number of new wireless customers who transferred their existing phone number from another carrier.)
- Average Call handling Time - Service (Direction: Low value is better, Description: Average duration of calls handled by customer service agents related to service issues.)
- NPS Score (Direction: High value is better, Description: Net Promoter Score, measuring customer loyalty and willingness to recommend the service.)
- Wireless Net Adds (Direction: High value is better, Description: The net change in wireless subscribers, calculated as gross adds minus disconnects.)
- Wireless Churn Rate (Direction: Low value is better, Description: The percentage of wireless subscribers who cancelled or did not renew their subscriptions.)
- Number Of Customers with Autopay Discount (Direction: High value is better, Description: Count of customers who are enrolled in autopay and receive a discount.)


Allowed relationship types:
