arpa,negatively impacts,wireless churn rate,"higher arpa often reflects customer satisfaction and loyalty, thus reducing churn rate."
average call handling time - service,directly proportional to,wireless churn rate,"if average call handlgling for service related call increases , customer dissatifcation increases and churn rate increases."
average call handling time - service,negatively impacts,nps score,"longer call handling times may lead to lower customer satisfaction, thus decreasing nps score."
average call handling time - service,positively impacts,wireless port out,poor service leading to longer call handling times might increase customer churn and port-outs.
nps score,inversely proportional to,wireless churn rate,"high nps reflects satisfaction, leading to lower churn. lower nps score indicates dissatisfaction, leading to higher churn."
nps score,positively impacts,wireless net adds,"higher nps scores indicate satisfied customers who are more likely to recommend the service, leading to potential growth in net adds."
number of customers with autopay discount,decreases the value of,wireless churn rate,"customers enrolled in autopay with a discount are less likely to cancel or not renew their subscriptions, reducing the churn rate."
number of customers with autopay discount,decreases the value of,wireless port out,"autopay users are more loyal, less likely to port out."
Wireless Net Adds AAL,positively impacts,arpa,"when existing customers add more lines (aal), the average revenue per account (arpa) increases as more services are being used."
Wireless Net Adds AAL,positively impacts,wireless net adds,more lines added by existing customers increase the total net adds.
Wireless Net Adds AAL,related metric,wireless net adds,both metrics are related to the net increase in wireless customers.
Wireless Net Adds New customers,related metric,Wireless Net Adds AAL,both are components of overall wireless net adds.
Wireless Net Adds New customers,related metric,wireless net adds,both metrics are related to the net increase in wireless customers.
wireless net adds,decreases the value of,wireless churn rate,"more net adds often reflect improved retention, reducing churn rate."
wireless net adds,positively impacts,arpa,"net adds increase the user base, thus potentially increasing average revenue per account arpa."
wireless port in,increases the value of,wireless net adds,port-ins directly contribute to net adds.
wireless port out,decreases the value of,wireless net adds,port-outs reduce net adds.
wireless port out,increases the value of,wireless churn rate,"when more customers transfer their phone number to another carrier (port out), the churn rate increases as more subscribers are leaving."
wireless port out,related metric,wireless churn rate,both metrics are related to customer retention and churn.
